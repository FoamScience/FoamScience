### Hi there 👋

A CFD PhD student who likes getting involved in DevOps and OSS, but just another
Math guy underneath.

You'll find cool OpenFOAM-related projects here.

<!--
**FoamScience/FoamScience** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
