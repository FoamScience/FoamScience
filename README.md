### Hi there 👋

A CFD PhD student who likes getting involved in DevOps and OSS, but just another
Math guy underneath. You'll find cool OpenFOAM-related projects here.

<!--
**FoamScience/FoamScience** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

## Important Repositories

These are the repositories that **I deem** to be important and stable enough for mentioning here:

### OpenFOAM projects

These are the projects that I've been working on, or have been a main dev of:
